## [v0.3.0]() - 2024-07-15
### Changes

* RENV: added new renv where dependencies are built in a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instance with R installed. 
* CHANGES: added CHANGES.md

## [v0.2.1](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-treat-simmer/releases/tag/v0.2.1) - 2024-07-12
### Fixed

* FIX(results analysis): patched results_replication_table chain of functions as this was relying on a global instance of exp (a list containing all parameters for the simulation experiment). This now requires a list to be passed to the function.
